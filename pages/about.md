## About the Collection

The items on this website are a few of the smaller, yet important collections that were inventoried through the University History Project in 2025. While not comprehensive, it is hoped that this documentation helps to capture and record various collecting entities on campus in the absense of a formal Western Carolina University Archives.

Collecting entities include the following (not all are documented visually on this site):
•	Athletics
•	Belcher College of Fine and performing Arts – Former Dean George Brown’s Collection of student art
•	English
o	Honors College
o	Literary Festival posters (most are signed by authors before becoming more popular)
•	Facilities
•	Highlands Biological Station – Library and Archive
•	Herbarium
•	Pride of the Mountains Marching Band Archives
•	Psychology
•	Stage and Screen
•	Steam Plant
•	University Center
•	WWCU Radio Station
